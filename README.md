# Purpose of This Repo

This repo is meant to be used to keep things organized during content development and act as the source of truth for all exercises related to this content.
 
## Repository Structure

This repo contains a folder for each exercise and demo.

Example
```
demo-1-hello
demo-2-world
demo-3-foo
exercise-2-world
exercise-3-foo
exercise-4-bar
```

Three exercise folders and three demo folders have been provided as a template; However, you may need to add more or possibly use less depending on what is needed.

If you require an additional lesson folder, you can make a copy of another folder and paste it into the root directory.

### Folder Structure - Demos

Each demo folder should contain the final demo code as well as any supporting files.

### Folder Structure - Exercises

Each exercise folder should contain all files and instructions necessary for the exercises along with the solution. The solutions for these exercises will be shared with students. See the `README` in the exercise folders for information about folder structure.

### Folder Structure - Shared Datasets

The `shared-datasets` folder can be used for any data files that will be used in multiple demos or exercises. It is optional and can be deleted if not applicable.

## Updating this README

When the lesson content is complete and you no longer need these instructions, replace the contents of this README with a student-facing description of how to use the repository.
